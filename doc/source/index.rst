Welcome to Neutron VPNaaS developer documentation!
==================================================

This provides Virtual Private Network as a Service (VPNaaS) capabilities to Neutron.
Maintained as a separate repo, this works in conjunction with the Neutron repo to
provide VPN services for OpenStack. The `VPNaaS API`_ is implementation as an
extension to Neutron's networking API:

.. _`VPNaaS API`: http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2-ext.html#vpnaas-v2.0

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on VPNaaS and other components of OpenStack
can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_ and the `Neutron section of the wiki`_ (see
the VPN related pages).
The `Neutron Development wiki`_ is also a good resource for new contributors.
